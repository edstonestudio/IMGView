# IMGView

This is a simple and responsive PHP script that allows you to easily navigate between images like a slideshow.

Best used for showcasing design concepts to clients, the script will show the file name as the page title and dynamically create a dropdown list of all of image files within the same directory, and make it easy for viewers to navigate between the images.

## To Use

To use, just drop the "index.php" file into an online folder with supported images (jpg, png, gif). You can easily modify the layout and overall look-and-feel within this single PHP file. Be sure to modify the footer information with your own.

## Future Updates

URL Rewriting to include filename as alias<br>
Displaying of Exif data<br>
Additional versions and design styles
